ZeframMvc
=========

ZeframMvc integrates Zend Framework 2's [ModuleManager](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-modulemanager) and [ServiceManager](https://github.com/zendframework/zend-servicemanager) in a ZF1 application.

It is based on the ideas (and the code) from [HumusMvc](https://github.com/prolic/HumusMvc), but  it tries to introduce as little ZF2 specific logic as possible, which makes it easier to integrate with an existing ZF1 applications.
